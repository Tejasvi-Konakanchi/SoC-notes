# Switch, Bits and Boolean Algebra
Digital Electronics handle data in bits (0 or 1).

## Switch
A switch is one of the easiest ways to represent a bit.

| Switch State | Binary Bit | Meaning    |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| OFF          | 0          | Low, False |
| ON           | 1          | High, True |

Since Switch has two states they naturally represent a boolean variable (true or false). You can use multiple switches to represent different levels (using Truth Tables) as shown below

| Switch A | Switch B | Boolean Expression | Output | Notes |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------ | ----- |
| OFF (0)  | OFF (0)  | A AND B            | 0      |position 1|
| OFF (0)  | ON (1)   | A AND B            | 0      |position 2|
| ON (1)   | OFF (0)  | A AND B            | 0      |position 3|
| ON (1)   | ON (1)   | A AND B            | 1      |position 4|

## Truth Tables
- no.of rows = 2^(no.of variables/switches).
- Allocate T/F or 0/1, with the pattern (4 0s/1s, 2 0s 1s, 1 0s 1s).

## Boolean Algebra
- It is the set of rules, used to simplify the given logic expression without changing its functionality.
- It is used when number of variables is (3-4). It gets tedious otherwise, so we use Kmap method.

<b> What is a logic expression? </b>
<br>
A logic expression is a mathematical way of describing a digital circuit. It tells you how the output depends on one or more inputs.

Y = A . b, is a logic expresion, describing the output Y. Y will be 1, if A and b are both 1. This is explained in the expression
</br>

<b> Rules: </b>
<br>
1. Compliments: A = 0, A' = 1, (A')' = 0
2. AND( Y = A . B): 
- A = A . A; 
- 0 . 0 = 0; 
- 1 . 1 = 1; 
- A . 0 = 0;
- A . 1 = A;
- A . A' = 0;

3. OR( Y = A + B): 
- 0 + 0 = 0
- 1 + 0 = 1
- A + 0 =  depends on A. (0 or 1)
- A + 1 = 1
- A + A' = 1

4. Distributive Law
- A . (B + C ) = A . B + A . C
- A + (B + C) = (A + B) . (A + C)
- A + A'B = (A + A') . (A + B) = A + B

5. Commutative Law
- A + B = B + A
- A . B = B . A

6. Associative Law
- (A . B) C = A . (B . C)

7. Priority
- NOT > AND > OR

8. De-Morgan's Law
- (A + B)' = A' . B'
- (A . B)' = A' + B'

Boolean Algebra is used to minimize the hardware used, reduce cost, and increase the speed of processing.

<b> Redundancy Theorem: </b>
Used to simplify boolean expressions.
<br> 
1. Your equation has 3 variables
2. Each variable is repeated twice
3. One variable is complimented

If the above three conditions are satisfied then you can use this theorem to simplify your experssion. Which is simply writing the equation such that each element is repeated only once, and you specifically keep the term with the compliment untouched.
